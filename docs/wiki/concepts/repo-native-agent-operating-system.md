# Repo-Native Agent Operating System

Open Scaffold treats a repository as the operating substrate for human-plus-agent work. The repo holds the durable protocol: mission, roadmap, plans, handoffs, run packets, evidence, decisions, and release receipts.

The “operating system” metaphor does not mean Open Scaffold is an autonomous agent runtime. It means the repo provides stable conventions that different humans, agents, task systems, and runtime harnesses can use without relying on hidden session state.

## What the repo owns

- Product intent and constraints.
- Work item scope and acceptance criteria.
- Evidence and verification receipts.
- Handoff contracts between orchestrators and execution lanes.
- Public project knowledge in this wiki.

## What the repo does not own

- Live chat state.
- Private owner context.
- Long-running process supervision by default.
- Credentials or runtime-specific secret state.

# Runtime Profiles

Runtime profiles make Open Scaffold runtime selection declarative and extensible without making Open Scaffold core an installer, marketplace, or process supervisor.

A runtime profile is data. It tells Open Scaffold how a selected runtime lane should be recorded in a run packet. A coordinator or adapter may later consume that run packet and launch the real runtime outside core.

```text
Open Scaffold core = validate profile + package run intent + preserve evidence gates
Runtime adapter     = translate run packet + launch selected runtime + return receipt/evidence
Runtime harness     = execute while alive
Operator            = approve commit/push/merge/publish gates
```

## Commands

```bash
osc runtimes list
osc runtimes show omx
osc run .osc/plans/active/001-demo.md --runtime omx --workflow plan
```

`osc runtimes list` prints the visible profile id, source, executor lane, status, and display name.

`osc runtimes show <id>` prints the selected profile JSON plus its source.

## Profile sources

Runtime profiles currently resolve from two scopes:

1. **Built-in profiles** shipped with Open Scaffold:
   - `omc` — OMC / oh-my-claudecode lane for Claude Code-oriented workflows.
   - `omx` — OMX / oh-my-codex lane for Codex-oriented workflows.
   - `plain` — runtime-neutral prompt package for any capable agent.
   - `human` — manual execution with evidence gates.
   - `custom` — placeholder lane for adapter-defined execution.
2. **Project-local profiles** in `.osc/runtimes/*.json`.

Project-local profiles are checked into the repo and should be reviewed like other project configuration. They are useful for company agents, private wrappers, or experimental runtimes that are not built into Open Scaffold.

Built-in profile ids are reserved. A project-local profile cannot silently override `omc`, `omx`, `plain`, `human`, or `custom`.

## Runtime profile schema

Minimal project-local example:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "open-scaffold.runtime-profile.v1",
  "id": "company-review-bot",
  "displayName": "Company Review Bot",
  "lane": "plain-agent",
  "status": "user-defined",
  "description": "Project-local review bot profile.",
  "links": {
    "homepage": "https://internal.example.com/review-bot"
  },
  "workflows": {
    "plan": "company-review-bot plan",
    "execute": "company-review-bot run"
  },
  "defaults": {
    "workflow": "plan",
    "harnessSkill": "company-review-bot plan",
    "operatorSurface": "none"
  },
  "install": {
    "humanHint": "Install through the internal developer portal.",
    "auto": false
  },
  "launch": {
    "owner": "external-adapter",
    "commandTemplate": "company-review-bot run <run.json>",
    "expectedAdapterId": null,
    "spawning": false
  },
  "evidence": {
    "receiptSchema": "open-scaffold.dispatch-receipt.v1",
    "expectedPaths": [".osc/runs/<run_id>/dispatch-receipt.json"]
  },
  "compatibility": {
    "minScaffoldSchema": "open-scaffold.run.v1"
  },
  "lastReviewed": "2026-05-15",
  "notes": "User-defined profile. Open Scaffold core validates the package; the adapter owns runtime behavior."
}
```

### Required fields

- `schemaVersion`: must be `open-scaffold.runtime-profile.v1`.
- `id`: lowercase profile id used by `--runtime <id>`.
- `displayName`: human-readable name.
- `lane`: one of `omc-claude`, `omx-codex`, `plain-agent`, `human`, or `custom`.
- `status`: one of `builtin`, `adapter-candidate`, or `user-defined`.
- `description`: short public-safe description.

### Workflow mapping

`workflows` maps Open Scaffold workflow names to the runtime/harness command token that an adapter should use.

Supported workflow keys are:

- `interview`
- `plan`
- `team`
- `loop`
- `execute`
- `goal`
- `custom`

For example, the built-in `omx` profile maps `plan` to `$ralplan`; the built-in `omc` profile maps `plan` to `/ralplan`.

If a profile has `defaults.workflow`, then `osc run --runtime <id>` can infer the workflow when the user does not provide `--workflow`.

## Security and boundary rules

Runtime profiles are treated as untrusted project configuration.

In v0:

- Profiles are JSON data only.
- Open Scaffold core validates profiles before use.
- `install.auto` must be `false`.
- `launch.spawning` must be `false`.
- Open Scaffold may display `install.humanHint` or `launch.commandTemplate`, but it does not execute them.
- Profiles cannot grant commit, push, merge, or publish authority.
- Runtime-local logs/session state are forensic until promoted into `.osc/runs`, tracked evidence docs, GitHub artifacts, or release notes.

This is deliberate. Open Scaffold's job is to preserve the source-of-truth chain and package dispatchable intent. Runtime-specific adapters own installation, authentication, session lifecycle, tmux/process management, and provider-specific launch details.

## OMC, OMX, GSD, and custom runtimes

OMC and OMX are built-in adapter-candidate profiles because Open Scaffold already has a run-packet selection surface and conformance fixture coverage for those lanes.

GSD and other frameworks can be represented as project-local `user-defined` profiles today. They should not be described as certified or built-in integrations until an adapter has passed the conformance expectations and produced public evidence.

## Non-goals for runtime profiles v0

Runtime profiles v0 does not add:

- `osc runtimes install`
- `osc runtimes add https://...`
- hosted registries or marketplace behavior
- network fetching
- arbitrary script execution
- automatic runtime spawning
- credential handling
- model/task benchmarking claims

Those are future roadmap questions that require separate safety design, adapter evidence, and owner approval.

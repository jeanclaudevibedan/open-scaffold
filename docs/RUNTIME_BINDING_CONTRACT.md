# Runtime Binding Contract

Open Scaffold core creates bounded run packages. Runtime bindings consume those packages and launch a chosen execution lane outside core. This document defines the contract between the repo-native Open Scaffold package and any coordinator, adapter, harness, agent, or human lane that executes it.

## Executive rule

```text
Open Scaffold core packages.
A coordinator decides.
A binding launches.
A harness or human executes.
Evidence returns.
Postflight closes.
```

`spawning: false` in `run.json` is not a missing feature. It is the boundary that keeps generic Open Scaffold portable.

## What is a runtime binding?

A runtime binding is the glue that turns a run packet into a concrete execution attempt.

Examples:

- a coordinator script that reads `.osc/runs/<run_id>/run.json` and starts an OMX `$ralplan` session;
- an OMC-specific command that turns a plan into a Claude Code `/team` handoff;
- a GitHub bot that assigns a plain agent to a branch and links the PR;
- a human operator who reads the generated prompt package and performs the work manually.

A binding is not the Open Scaffold core. It may be a separate repo, plugin, bot, shell script, GitHub Action, IDE extension, or manual procedure.

## Layer ownership

| Layer | Owns | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| Open Scaffold core | plan/spec/run package, package-quality fields, prompt artifacts, evidence locations, commit policy | runtime auth, process lifecycle, autonomous spawning |
| Coordinator/task bridge | selecting work, choosing lane, assigning owner, retry/block/review state | final evidence by itself |
| Runtime binding | translating package to a specific launch, attaching runtime metadata, returning artifacts | project truth, merge authority unless granted |
| Harness/agent/human lane | execution while alive | canonical task database, approval gate |
| Operator surface | status/questions/approval messages | source of truth |
| GitHub/evidence | public review, CI, release, proof | runtime session truth |

## Binding lifecycle

```text
1. Select task or plan
2. Create or read .osc/runs/<run_id>/run.json
3. Validate packageQuality.executable
4. Validate executor lane and harness skill
5. Check safety and isolation requirements
6. Launch or hand off to selected lane outside core
7. Attach runtime bindings back to run metadata/evidence
8. Route questions by question_id -> run_id
9. Promote outputs, logs, diffs, PRs, and verification evidence
10. Produce completion report or blocker
11. Postflight using slice-close protocol
12. Close, retry, amend, block, or create next slice
```

## Required input: run packet

A binding should expect a run packet like:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "open-scaffold.run.v1",
  "runId": "20260512T120000Z-runtime-binding",
  "taskId": "issue:42",
  "mode": "run",
  "status": "created",
  "namespace": ".osc",
  "plan": {
    "path": ".osc/plans/active/004-runtime-binding-contract.md",
    "goal": "Define the runtime binding contract.",
    "acceptanceCriteria": [],
    "verificationSteps": [],
    "openQuestions": []
  },
  "packageQuality": {
    "executable": true,
    "blockers": [],
    "requiredAction": null
  },
  "executor": {
    "lane": "omx-codex",
    "harnessSkill": "$ralplan",
    "spawning": false
  },
  "runtime": {
    "repoPath": "/repo",
    "worktreePath": null,
    "branch": "docs/runtime-binding-contract",
    "tmuxSession": null,
    "processId": null
  },
  "bindings": {
    "operatorSurface": "github-pr",
    "operatorThreadId": null,
    "githubIssue": "42",
    "githubPr": null
  },
  "artifacts": {
    "runDir": ".osc/runs/20260512T120000Z-runtime-binding",
    "manifest": ".osc/runs/20260512T120000Z-runtime-binding/run.json",
    "prompts": [],
    "logs": [],
    "outputs": [],
    "evidence": []
  },
  "commitPolicy": "no commit/push unless explicitly approved by the operator"
}
```

Bindings may enrich this record, but they should not rewrite past attempts. A retry is a new run.

## Package validation gate

Before launching anything, the binding must verify:

```yaml
package_quality:
  executable: true
  blockers: []
plan:
  goal: present
  acceptance_criteria: present and testable
  verification_steps: present
executor:
  lane: supported by this binding
  harness_skill: allowed for this lane or null for plain/manual lanes
runtime:
  repo_path: exists or intentionally remote
  branch_or_worktree: isolated enough for planned work
commit_policy: explicit
open_questions: no blocking questions
```

If the package is not executable, do not improvise implementation. Route to clarification, deep-interview, plan amendment, blocker, or manual correction.

## Binding responsibilities

A binding should:

1. Read the run packet and generated prompts.
2. Refuse unsupported lanes, unsafe packages, and blocking open questions.
3. Preserve the commit policy.
4. Create or select an isolated worktree/session when needed.
5. Launch the runtime or produce a manual handoff outside core.
6. Attach runtime metadata:
   - session ID;
   - process ID;
   - tmux/session name;
   - worktree path;
   - branch;
   - log path;
   - operator thread/comment ID;
   - PR number if opened.
7. Emit glass-cockpit events for status, blockers, questions, approval requests, completion, and evidence receipts when an operator surface is bound.
8. Route human answers by `question_id -> run_id`.
9. Promote final artifacts and evidence to `.osc/runs`, tracked evidence docs, PRs, issues, or release notes.
10. Leave approval/merge/release to the configured gate.

## Explicit non-responsibilities

Generic Open Scaffold core does not own:

- installing or authenticating Claude, Codex, OMC, OMX, or any other runtime;
- tmux/process supervision;
- background daemons or watchdogs;
- Discord/Slack/Telegram/GitHub bot implementation;
- automatic commits, pushes, merges, or releases;
- runtime-specific state folders;
- resolving product ambiguity after dispatch.

Runtime-specific projects or coordinators may own these, but must promote durable outcomes back into the Open Scaffold chain.

## Supported lane examples

### OMC / Claude Code lane

Use when Claude Code plus OMC workflow modes are intentionally selected.

Example executor:

```json
{
  "lane": "omc-claude",
  "harnessSkill": "/ralplan",
  "spawning": false
}
```

Binding behavior:

```text
Read .osc/runs/<run_id>/package.md.
Launch or hand off to Claude Code/OMC with /ralplan, /team, /ralph, or /ultrawork as selected.
Do not mutate unrelated worktrees.
Return plan/output/evidence paths to .osc/runs or PR.
If blocked, emit BLOCKED with question_id.
```

OMC runtime state is forensic until promoted.

### OMX / Codex lane

Use when Codex plus OMX workflow modes are intentionally selected.

Example executor:

```json
{
  "lane": "omx-codex",
  "harnessSkill": "$ralplan",
  "spawning": false
}
```

Binding behavior:

```text
Read .osc/runs/<run_id>/package.md.
Launch or hand off to Codex/OMX with $ralplan, $team, $ralph, $ultrawork, or $ultragoal as selected.
Attach session/log/worktree metadata back to the run.
Return completion report, artifacts, verification, and blocker questions by ID.
Never treat OMX state as canonical truth unless promoted.
```

OMX is not automatically the runtime engine for Hermes, OMC, or Open Scaffold. It is a selected Codex execution lane.

### Plain-agent lane

Use when a capable coding agent can read the package directly without a harness.

Example executor:

```json
{
  "lane": "plain-agent",
  "harnessSkill": null,
  "spawning": false
}
```

Binding behavior:

```text
Give the agent the package.md and relevant files.
Require it to report changed files, verification, evidence paths, open blockers, and commit policy compliance.
If it cannot answer with evidence, do not close the slice.
```

### Human/manual lane

Use when a person performs the work.

Example executor:

```json
{
  "lane": "manual",
  "harnessSkill": null,
  "spawning": false
}
```

Binding behavior:

```text
Show the human objective, scope, acceptance criteria, verification, and evidence expectations.
The human updates files/PR/evidence manually.
Postflight still uses the same slice-close protocol.
```

## Failure-state taxonomy

Use these states when a binding cannot complete cleanly:

| State | Meaning | Required action |
|---|---|---|
| `package_not_executable` | Missing goal, AC, verification, or blocking questions exist | Clarify, amend, or regenerate package |
| `unsupported_lane` | Binding cannot run requested executor lane or skill | Choose another binding/lane or update package |
| `prompt_rejected` | Runtime refused or could not parse the handoff | Repair prompt/package; retry as new run if substantial |
| `session_blocked` | Runtime is waiting on a decision, auth, dependency, or environment | Emit `question_id`/blocker and wait |
| `artifact_missing` | Runtime claims completion but required output/evidence is absent | Do not close; request repair or retry |
| `verification_failed` | Tests/checks/AC verification failed | Fix in same branch/run if small, otherwise create retry run |
| `human_input_needed` | Operator decision required | Send approval/question event with correlation IDs |
| `cancelled` | Run intentionally stopped | Preserve partial artifacts if useful; record reason |
| `runtime_error` | Harness/process crashed or transport failed | Preserve logs; classify retry/blocker |

Do not hide failures in chat. Record them in the run/evidence/task chain.

## Evidence return contract

At completion, the binding should produce or point to:

```yaml
run_id: 20260512T120000Z-runtime-binding
status: completed | blocked | failed | cancelled
changed_files:
  - docs/RUNTIME_BINDING_CONTRACT.md
artifacts:
  - .osc/runs/<run_id>/output.md
logs:
  - .osc/runs/<run_id>/runtime.log
verification:
  - command: ./verify.sh --standard
    result: pass
  - command: npm test
    result: pass
known_gaps:
  - "No executable adapter implemented in core."
questions: []
next_action: postflight
```

Then use `docs/SLICE_CLOSE_PROTOCOL.md` to decide whether the slice is approved, weak-approved, rejected, or blocked.

## Cockpit events

If an operator surface is bound, the binding may emit events using `docs/GLASS_COCKPIT_PROTOCOL.md`:

- `session_start` when execution begins;
- `status` for progress;
- `blocker` when stuck;
- `question` when human input is required;
- `completion_report` when work finishes;
- `evidence_receipt` when proof is available;
- `approval_request` before merge/release;
- `cancellation` when stopped.

Events must carry `task_id`, `run_id`, `question_id`, evidence path, issue, PR, or release links when applicable.

## PR and release handoff

When a binding opens or updates a PR, the PR body should include:

- roadmap item or issue/task ID;
- plan/spec path;
- run ID and run packet path;
- executor lane and harness skill;
- changed files summary;
- verification commands and results;
- evidence/postflight path;
- Codex/CI/human review status;
- commit/merge policy.

GitHub is the publication layer, not the runtime transcript.

## Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- adding runtime-specific spawning to generic Open Scaffold core;
- letting a binding execute packages with blocking questions;
- launching OMC/OMX/plain agents from vague prose instead of a run packet;
- treating runtime state folders as durable truth;
- routing answers by latest chat message instead of `question_id`;
- allowing multiple runtimes to mutate one worktree without explicit isolation;
- allowing a binding to merge/publish unless the package grants that authority;
- calling a run complete without artifacts and verification evidence.

## Relationship to other protocols

- `docs/TASK_RUN_MODEL.md` defines task/run/question/operator identity.
- `docs/RUNTIME_HARNESS_DISPATCH.md` explains the high-level coordinator-to-harness flow.
- `docs/GLASS_COCKPIT_PROTOCOL.md` defines visible operator events emitted during binding execution.
- `docs/SLICE_CLOSE_PROTOCOL.md` defines postflight, approval strength, correction routing, and next-slice inheritance.
- `docs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md` defines the issue/branch/PR/review/release publication chain.

## Product implication

Open Scaffold can support many runtimes precisely because core does less:

```text
Core stays portable.
Bindings become specific.
Evidence stays durable.
Operators stay in control.
```

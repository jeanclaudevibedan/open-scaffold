# Runtime Binding Conformance Fixture

This fixture demonstrates the smallest safe adapter contract: a fake/local adapter consumes a run packet, writes a dispatch receipt and evidence artifact, and exits without launching a real runtime.

It is not a production adapter SDK. It is a deterministic conformance target for future adapter packages.

## Run the fixture

Given a run packet at `.osc/runs/<run_id>/run.json`:

```bash
node docs/examples/runtime-binding-conformance/fake-local-adapter.mjs \
  .osc/runs/<run_id>/run.json \
  --out .osc/runs/<run_id>/dispatch-receipt.json
```

Expected result:

- exits `0` for an executable package with no blockers and `executor.spawning: false`;
- writes `dispatch-receipt.json` with `schemaVersion: open-scaffold.dispatch-receipt.v1`;
- writes a deterministic evidence markdown file at the first `artifacts.evidence[]` path, or a default fake-local evidence path;
- states that no runtime was launched, no credentials were read, and no network was required.

## Boundary

The fixture validates the adapter boundary before real runtime work exists:

```text
Open Scaffold core packages work.
A fake/local adapter consumes the package.
The adapter writes receipt/evidence artifacts.
No Claude, Codex, OMC, OMX, GSD, or other runtime is launched.
```

Future adapters can use this fixture as a minimum behavior target before adding runtime-specific launch mechanics.

Open Scaffold gives solo developers and small teams a lightweight way to keep AI coding work traceable. It stores mission, roadmap, plans, run packets, evidence, decisions, and handoff notes in the repo so humans and agents can see what was asked, changed, verified, and approved.

Use it when AI work spans sessions, PRs, agents, or review gates — especially when you need proof without a documentation swamp.

> **What it is:** a repo-native source-of-truth protocol that packages work for humans, agents, coordinators, and runtime adapters.
>
> **What it is not:** an agent runtime, Discord bot, daemon, task database, model ranker, or code reviewer. Those live in tools you choose; the scaffold is what they read and write.

The runtime handoff is intentionally simple:

```text
User selects runtime
  -> Open Scaffold reads runtime profile
  -> Open Scaffold creates the run packet
  -> Adapter/coordinator launches the actual runtime
  -> Runtime does the work
  -> Evidence comes back into Open Scaffold
```

Plain English: Open Scaffold keeps the work truth in the repo. You choose an agent runtime. Open Scaffold packages the work. A runtime adapter executes it outside core. Evidence comes back. Humans approve.

## The problem

AI agents can write useful code, but the workflow often disappears into chat logs and terminal sessions:

```text
Idea -> chat thread -> agent session -> PR -> "looks done?"
```

Weeks later nobody can reconstruct intent, acceptance criteria, verification evidence, or human approval.

Open Scaffold fixes that by making the repository the shared memory. Chat, Discord, terminals, GitHub comments, and agent transcripts can help operate the work, but durable truth lives in files and PRs.

For the same idea in three diagrams (problem, loop, system boundary), see [`docs/WHY_OPEN_SCAFFOLD.md`](docs/WHY_OPEN_SCAFFOLD.md).

## 60-second demo

Want the loop before the theory? Read [`docs/EXAMPLES.md`](docs/EXAMPLES.md#60-second-viewer-demo). It shows the four artifacts that matter:

```text
Mission -> plan -> verification -> evidence/status
```

For a non-recursive version of the same loop, read the [downstream walkthrough](docs/examples/downstream-walkthrough.md): a tiny shell CLI carried through mission, plan, run packet, evidence, and close. For broader usage shapes — solo developer, team control-room, GitHub-only workflow, and runtime harness handoff — see the [examples index](docs/examples/README.md).

## What you get

- **Direction:** `MISSION.md` and `ROADMAP.md` keep intent visible.
- **Work specs:** `.osc/plans/` holds small, immutable plans with acceptance criteria.
- **Change history:** amendments record scope changes without rewriting the original plan.
- **Run packets:** `.osc/runs/<run_id>/run.json` packages a plan for a chosen runtime lane.
- **Evidence:** `.osc/releases/` records what shipped, how it was verified, and what follows.
- **Checks:** `./verify.sh` and `osc verify` catch stale state, broken evidence, and plan drift.
- **Agent entry points:** `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` tell coding agents how to operate without fresh explanations.

The loop:

```text
Roadmap or issue
  -> plan
  -> run packet / task id
  -> branch / PR
  -> verification evidence
  -> approval / amendment / next slice
```

## Quickstart

### 1. Initialize the scaffold tier you need

Use the CLI when Node is available:

```bash
npx open-scaffold init --tier min --target <your-project>
cd <your-project>
```

Tiers:

- `min` — mission, rules, plan workflow/template, release evidence folder, and shell helpers.
- `standard` — `min` plus README/roadmap, agent instructions, amendment helper, and core docs.
- `max` — `standard` plus GitHub/glass-cockpit/runtime docs, delegation helper, and advanced `.osc/` folders.

The initializer is local-only: it does not require network access after the package is present, does not call GitHub or agent services, and refuses to overwrite existing files unless `--force` is supplied.

If you prefer GitHub's template flow:

```bash
gh repo create <your-project> --template graphanov/open-scaffold --clone
cd <your-project>
```

Or use GitHub's **Use this template** button.

### 2. Bootstrap the mission

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

Bootstrap asks what the project is, what it should achieve, and what it should not do. That mission gates later plans.

### 3. Write the first plan

If the goal is clear, tell your agent:

```text
Write a plan in .osc/plans/active/ for <task> using .osc/plans/handoff-template.md.
```

If the goal is fuzzy, ask the agent to interview you first, then write the plan. Or copy the template manually:

```bash
cp .osc/plans/handoff-template.md .osc/plans/active/my-first-task.md
```

### 4. Verify the scaffold

```bash
./verify.sh
```

Use `./verify.sh --standard` before calling a meaningful slice done.

### 5. Select a runtime and create a run packet

Open Scaffold core does not spawn agents. It packages work so a coordinator, adapter, or human can dispatch it.

The runtime flow is:

```text
User selects runtime
  -> Open Scaffold reads runtime profile
  -> Open Scaffold creates the run packet
  -> Adapter/coordinator launches the actual runtime
  -> Runtime does the work
  -> Evidence comes back into Open Scaffold
```

Example:

```bash
npm run osc -- run .osc/plans/active/my-first-task.md \
  --task-id TASK-001 \
  --runtime omx \
  --workflow plan \
  --operator-surface github \
  --repo "$PWD"
```

For custom runtimes, add a project-local profile in `.osc/runtimes/<id>.json`, then use `--runtime <id>`. Read this in layers:

1. [`docs/RUNTIME_SELECTION.md`](docs/RUNTIME_SELECTION.md) — choosing `--runtime` and `--workflow`;
2. [`docs/RUNTIME_PROFILES.md`](docs/RUNTIME_PROFILES.md) — built-in and project-local runtime profiles;
3. [`docs/RUNTIME_BINDING_CONTRACT.md`](docs/RUNTIME_BINDING_CONTRACT.md) — what an adapter/coordinator must do after the packet exists.

## Runtime-neutral by design

Open Scaffold is not an agent runtime, Discord bot, PR reviewer, or task database. It is the repo protocol those tools can share.

- **Coordinators / task state:** GitHub Issues, Linear/Jira, custom bots, or private deployment examples such as Hermes Kanban decide what should happen next.
- **Runtime lanes:** Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, OMC, OMX, Aider, or a human terminal can execute bounded work outside Open Scaffold core.
- **Operator surfaces:** Discord, Slack, Telegram, GitHub comments, or CLI dashboards can show status and collect approvals.
- **Core truth:** mission, plans, amendments, run packets, evidence, decisions, and release notes stay in the repo.

Full map: [`docs/OPEN_SCAFFOLD_SYSTEM.md`](docs/OPEN_SCAFFOLD_SYSTEM.md), [`docs/TASK_RUN_MODEL.md`](docs/TASK_RUN_MODEL.md), [`docs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md`](docs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md), and [`docs/REFERENCE_TRUTH.md`](docs/REFERENCE_TRUTH.md).

## When it helps

Open Scaffold is useful when work needs to survive context loss:

- multi-session AI-assisted development;
- consulting and client delivery, where "what was asked, decided, and verified" must be reviewable later;
- compliance or audit-sensitive work that wants lightweight, file-level evidence instead of a heavier governance stack;
- multi-agent handoffs where chat history is not enough;
- projects where "done" needs acceptance criteria and verification, not vibes.

It is overkill for one-off scripts, disposable prototypes, or tasks that fit in a single clean session. The scaffold is the substrate; it does not replace SOC 2, ISO, or formal audit tooling — it gives those processes durable repo artifacts to point at.

---

## Where the roadmap is going

The current product direction is: make the source-of-truth loop undeniable, then let external runtimes plug into it through profiles and adapters. Open Scaffold now supports runtime selection and runtime profiles, but core still does not install, spawn, supervise, or benchmark runtimes.

Near-term roadmap work should improve clarity, adapter evidence, and validation. Real runtime launching, hosted registries, marketplace behavior, and model/task recommendations remain future hypotheses until separately designed and proven. See the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for the current milestone list.

## Dogfooded

Open Scaffold is built with Open Scaffold. The repo contains its own roadmap, plans, evidence notes, decisions, and PR history so the method can be inspected instead of merely claimed.
